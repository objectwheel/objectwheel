# objectwheel
Cross-Platform Rapid Application Development Platform
June 4th, 2022 Start of Readme. 
We are Opensource. Links to Youtube videos are coming showing the project's state. 
https://youtu.be/IQzO07_Z7uQ This video shows a lot of the features in Objectwheel. 
Objectwheel runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows with Mac probably being the most stable. 
The IDE creates APK files in the cloud from a series of javascript and qml code written
inside the IDE. This is similar to QT Creator. Code for the same for IOS was started but
not finished. Omer has been the only coder on this project so far with David coding a
previous attempt in Javafx.
